Intro:
I won a first place in UTM Robotic Arm Workshop 2025: This workshop was organised in the similar style of UTM Robocon AutoCar Challenge. A total of 12 tasks was given and a competition was held at the end. Around 70+ students joined the workshop but only ~20 participants showed up in the competition. There were two games: Game1 was to play tic-tac-toe using joystick control; Game2 was to stack a tower of 6 cubes using joystick or potentiometer control. I programmed my joystick control with inverse kinematics, to make the control more easier (I think this is critical for my winning). The main parts of my robotic arm were 3d-printed myself. I used STM32 Bluepill and programmed in CubeIDE.
